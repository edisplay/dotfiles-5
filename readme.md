![Preview](./screenshot.png)

### Powerline Fonts

https://github.com/powerline/fonts

### Color Theme - Argonaut

### VS Code Settings

### [zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) 
  
I have customized **[oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)** [ðŸš€ spaceship](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt) theme to look like the [pure prompt](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) I previously used, but discarded because it [mangled pinentry prompts](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure/issues/366).

### [z jumper](https://github.com/rupa/z)
  

Lets me [jump around in history without knowing/typing entire path](https://github.com/rupa/z), for example:

```
$ z dotfiles

# Hit Tab, Enter and you're there
$ ~/Code/dotfiles
```
