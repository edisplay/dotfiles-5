# Julie's dotfiles.

Cloned, striped and modified from [Paul Irish's dotfiles](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles/).

This repo is just for me and functions as a basic backup of my shortcuts, etc.

### Major differences
I removed anything I don't use or fully understand.
  * Removed vim
  * Removed osx defaults
  * Removed installed dependencies

### Shell
  * My `.bash_prompt` based on [@necolas dotfiles](https://github.com/necolas/dotfiles/blob/master/bash/bash_prompt). I found it to be neater and easier to understand.
